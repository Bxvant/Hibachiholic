When clicking on the "add to Favorites" button on any given menu item, it will be added to the Favorites page for easier access. The favorites page will house all of your favorited menu items and will display them as they appear on the main menu. You can reach this page by clicking on Favorties in the navigation bar.

When clicking on the "add to cart" button, that menu item will be placed in the cart with its corresponding price. Should you click on add to cart twice, it will add one quantity to the already existing item in the cart and update the total price for everything inside of the cart, should you decide to remove any item, there is a remove button next to each item. If you had 3 of the same item and want to remove one, the arrow keys will let you update the quantity directly from the cart. To get to your cart you can click on the shopping cart icon in the navigation bar :
